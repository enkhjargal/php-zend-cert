# Introduction

These functions enable you to engage with arrays and perform a range of operations on them. Arrays play a crucial role in the storage, control, and manipulation of groups of variables.

Both simple and multi-dimensional arrays are accommodated, and they can be generated by the user or by another function.

Specialized database handling functions facilitate array population from database queries, while several functions yield array results.
